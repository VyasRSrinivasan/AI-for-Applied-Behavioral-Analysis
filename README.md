# AI for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)

## Overview
Many people with autism and others have difficulties understanding subtle social cues and navigating complex social dynamics. Complex social dynamics are not black or white. There are a lot of nuances with social skills that are difficult for those on the autism spectrum to interpret

## Objective
To develop emotionally aware AI tools grounded in Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) that helps individuals who are neurodivergence to better understand, manage, and respond to social & emotional triggers with clarity and compassion.

## Problem Statement
### Problem:
Many people with autism and other neurodivergent traits have difficulty understanding subtle emotional or social cues, which results in anxiety, miscommunication, and stress.

### Gap:
There are many AI chatbots and emotional assistants out there, but only very few incorporate ABA — mostly to diagnose people who might be on the autism spectrum. 

### Opportunity:
Design an AI assistant that identifies emotional triggers and provides supportive, evidence-informed feedback using the ABA model.

## Users
- Individuals with Autism who are self-aware and want to improve
- ABA educators and therapist looking into digital assistive tools
- Parents and caregivers who want to help the child on the spectrum with emotional self-regulation

## Features
Trigger-response dataset
Retrieval logic

## DISCLAIMER
This tool is an experimental AI project inspired by Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). It's designed for educational and self-reflective use ONLY.
